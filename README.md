## graph-dynamic project
the project use the chromosome structure of genetic expression that is mentioned in the paper(http://www.cnki.com.cn/article/cjfdtotal-sclh2012s1024.htm).    
Run `com.cc.graph.gep.workflow` to see the result.You can configure the factor in `src/main/resources/application.conf`.  

Use `NSGA-II` alogrithm as the main solution to solve the dynamic network community evolution problem(`NMI` and `Modularity` as objective functions)
