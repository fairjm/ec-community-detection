# ec-community-detection
community detection of graph using EC.

## graph project
the project use the genetic expression that is mentioned in the paper(http://www.cnki.com.cn/article/cjfdtotal-sclh2012s1024.htm).    
Run `com.cc.graph.gep.workflow` to see the result.You can configure the factor in `src/main/resources/application.conf`.  
The paper is not well implemented.  
I have not implemented the `Map Equation` and I set the splitoff factor to 0 cause there is no merging function mentioned in the paper. 

## graph-java project  
a java version of the graph project(in progress).
